1.	Element strings were transformed using a python script
2. 	Training Data was split into "features_training.csv" & "targets_training.csv"
   	because I/O into Torch is a bitch.

3. 	Last 10 lines of TrainingDataSet were held out to asses performance of network,
	output stored in "benchmarking.txt"

4.	Predictions of Testing set saved under "predictions.txt"
	Disclaimer: They suck.
